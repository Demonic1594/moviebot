# Movie/Series Bot (BDFD)
An Open-Source BDFD-based movie/series bot. Free for everyone to use, consider giving credits when using the code(s) used in this project. Thanks.

# Commands, How to use?
- In the code editor, copy and paste this.
```
$httpGet[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyuxKurenai/moviebot/main/(name)]
$eval[$httpResult]
```
- Make sure to change the (name) to the command/onInteraction you're trying to get.
- As for why we use $eval is so that we're able to diagnose the issues directly and there's no need for the users have a difficult time setting it up.

# Variables
- Format: (name: value), leave the value blank if it is stated in the value parameter to be blank. Do not put blank in the value. This gets updated once a new variable is being used.
  > **library**: **blank**
  
# Notes
- When the code in Github has been edited, it'll take a few minutes for it to be rolled out to everyone and for it to affect the commands as is. We do not have any power on being able to update the github raw content instantly.

# Important
- This isnt maintained!
